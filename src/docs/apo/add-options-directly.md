# Add options to individual products

Apart from the option sets, the app offers a possibility to create options on a product level directly. This could be useful if you need only particular products to have some specific options assigned, and prevent these options from being overwritten by mistake if the options set is edited.

Steps:

1. From the app admin navigate to the left-side menu and click on **Products**. 
1. Find the required product to edit from the full products list and click on it. On its page, youâ€™ll see if it has any option sets already assigned to it. 
1. To add options to a product please follow the steps described in the [**Create an option set**](create-option-set.html) article, starting from the **section 3-d**.
