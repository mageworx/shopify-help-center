# Terminology explained

Here are the definitions of certain terms that you will find in the app:

- **Options** and **option values**. Lets' say you sell t-shirts of different colors. "Color" - would be your option. "White", "Black", "Blue", etc. - would be your option values. 
- **Option sets**. An option set is just a collection of different options that you want to reuse for multiple products. Let's say you sell different kinds of t-shirt, all of which have the same possible option choices: color and size. In that case you would create an option set, add to it color and size options, and then assign that option set to all your t-shirts. [Learn more](create-option-set.html) about creating option sets.  
- **Rules**. By adding rules you can specify how your options are interconnected. If, say, you want to allow your shoppers to pick a color only after they’ve selected a size - you can specify that logic with rules. [Learn more](rules-and-conditions.html) about adding rules.  
- **Option types**. When creating an option, you have to decide how your option is going to look and work. Whether it’s going to be a dropdown box for selecting a size, or a color swatch, or something else entirely, you define that by selecting an appropriate option type. [Learn more](option-types.html) about option types.
