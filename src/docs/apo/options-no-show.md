# My options don’t show on the product page

The app comes with automatic code installation. You just need to [create an option set](create-option-set.html) and [assign it to your products](add-options-via-option-sets.html) to see the options on the front-end.

If you performed the steps above but the options still do not show up, this means the app code failed to be installed. This may happen if your theme is highly customized or there is an external code that conflicts with our code. In this case, you might need to specify your theme’s selectors in the app’s settings.
 
We offer free installation services, so please feel free to contact us. We’ll send you a request for [collaborator access](collaborator-access.html) and configure the app manually upon your approval.
