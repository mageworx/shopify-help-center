## Features

* **It's just Markdown** — write your technical documentation in plain Markdown
  – no need to know HTML, JavaScript, or CSS. Material for MkDocs will do the
  heavy lifting and convert your writing to a beautiful and functional website.

* **Responsive by design** — built from the ground up to work on all sorts of 
  devices – from mobile phones to widescreens. The underlying fluid layout will 
  always adapt perfectly to the available screen space.

* **Static, yet searchable** — almost magically, your technical documentation 
  website will be searchable without any further ado. Material for MkDocs comes
  with built-in search – no server needed – that will instantly answer your
  users' queries.

* **Many configuration options** — change the color palette, font families, 
  language, icons, favicon and logo. Add a source repository link, links to your
  social profiles, Google Analytics and Disqus - all with a few lines of code.

* **Truly international** — thanks to many contributors, Material for MkDocs 
  includes translations for more than 40 languages and offers full native RTL 
  (right-to-left) support for languages such as Arabic, Persian (Farsi) and
  Hebrew.

* **Accessible** — Material for MkDocs provides extensible keyboard navigation
  and semantic markup including role attributes and landmarks. Furthermore, the
  layout is entirely based on `rem` values, respecting the user's default font
  size.

* **Beyond GitHub Markdown** — integrates natively with Python Markdown
  Extensions, offering additional elements like callouts, tabbed content
  containers, mathematical formulas, critic markup, task lists, and emojis.

* **Modern architecture** — Material for MkDocs's underlying codebase is built
  with TypeScript, RxJS, and SCSS, and is compiled with Webpack, bringing
  excellent possibilities for theme extension and customization.
