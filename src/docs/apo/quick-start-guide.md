# Quick start guide

After you've [installed](/apo/installation.html) the app, we suggest these steps to get started using it:

1. [Create a new option set](create-option-set.html) and add necessary options to it.
1. Optional: [add rules](rules-and-conditions.html) to your new option set
1. [Assign this option set](add-options-via-option-sets.html) to your products
1. Optional: configure app’s setting to your preference
1. To apply these changes to your live store, change the status of your option set to **Active** by clicking on the **Enable** button
1. Check on the front-end that the options show up on one of the products you’ve selected. If they don’t, you might need to specify your theme’s selectors in the app’s settings.
