# Installing the app

If you are new to this app, then navigate to the app’s [listing page](https://apps.shopify.com/advanced-product-options) on the Shopify app store, and click the Add app button. You will be guided through the standard install process, where you’ll be asked to give the app certain access permissions, and then approve the charge. If you’ve never installed this app before, you will be given a free trial period, and the billing will start after the trial is over. If you uninstall the app before the trial ends, you will not be charged.

After the app is downloaded, you need to make sure it’s activated on the target theme you are going to use the custom options for.

To do this, please click the **Activate** button within the status bar at the top of the page. First, you’ll be offered to see a short video of the activation process. You may skip the video by clicking the **Got it** button within the modal window.

After that, you’d be redirected to the Settings section of the app. To activate the app, please perform the following steps:

1. Select a theme you’d like to activate the app for. You may select the live theme or choose any other one from the **Show other themes** list.
