# Understanding option types

Here are the definitions of certain terms that you will find in the app:

- **Radio button** is an input type that allows for selecting only one option value at a time. It renders as small circles that are filled or highlighted when selected. Please note that it’s impossible to unselect a radio button, it’s only possible to switch between the values.
