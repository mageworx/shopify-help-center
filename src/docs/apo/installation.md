# Installing the app

If you are new to this app, then navigate to the app's [listing page](https://apps.shopify.com/advanced-product-options) on the Shopify app store, and click the Add app button. You will be guided through the standard install process, where you’ll be asked to give the app certain access permissions, and then approve the charge. If you’ve never installed this app besore, you will be given a free trial period, and the billing will start after the trial is over. If you uninstall the app before trial ends, you will not be charged.   

In case you are currently using the older version of our app, and want an update, please refer to the article dedicated to [migration](migration.html).
