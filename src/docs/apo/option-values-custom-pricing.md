# Managing custom pricing of option values

The app allows for adding price attributes to option values. The price of an option value will be added to/subtracted from the original product price upon selection. 

Steps:

1. Create an option with some values
1. From the option values expanded view, navigate to the **Advanced pricing** section
1. Tick the **Enable advanced pricing** checkbox
1. Select a **Price type**. It could either Fixed or Percent-based:
   - **Fixed** stands for the exact amount of money in the default store currency.
   - **Percent** is calculated based on the original product price.
1. Add a price value to the **Price** field. The app allows both positive and negative price attributes.
1. Optional: Add a price value to the **Compare price** field
1. Optional: Decide whether a price should be **Onetime** or not. If the **Onetime** checkbox is selected, the custom price will be added only once despite the quantity of the products added to the cart.
