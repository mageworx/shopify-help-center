# What is collaborator access and how to provide it

We offer free installation services and lifetime technical support. If you request our assistance with the app configuration, our dev team may need to log in to the store's backend to access the app admin and theme files. As a Shopify Partners, we have our own Partner Dashboard to send requests for collaborator permissions. We do not require full access and request for access to the Apps, Themes, and Products sections only. After we send a request, the store owner will receive an email about the request and notification on the Shopify Home.

You may find more information about the Collaborator Accounts [here](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/your-account/staff-accounts/collaborator-accounts).
