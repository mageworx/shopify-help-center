# Create an option set

Steps: 

1. From the app’s menu on the left select **Option sets** and on the page that opens click the **Create option set** button.
1. In the **Option set name** field provide a name for your set. This is for your records only, it will not show up on the front-end of your store. 
1. Underneath, in the tab called **Options** you will create the options and values for your option set. To start, click the **Add new option** button. 
1. From the dropdown that appears you’ll need to select the [type of the option](option-types.html) you want to create. For the argument’s sake, let’s assume you choose the **Swatch** option type.
1. You’ll need to provide a title for your option in the **Option title** field. This will show on your product page above the values of your option. So if you’re adding color swatch, you can name it simply “Color”. 
1. Optional: Select the **Option is required** checkbox only if you can’t allow shoppers to purchase your product without selecting from this option. For example, they can’t buy a t-shirt without selecting a size, in which case you would select Option is required. 
1. Optional: Below the Option title, there’s a More settings section, where you can add:
   - **Option nickname** - for your records only, shoppers will not see it
   - Select **Show quantity input box** only if you want to allow your shoppers to buy several items of this particular option. For example, if you option is 
   - **Description** - this will be visible to shoppers and will appear when they hover over a question mark icon to the left of your Option title. 
   - **Order** - specifies the order in which this option shows on the product page relative to other options. 
   - **CSS classes** - advanced setting for developers, allowing to specify which CSS classes to assign to this option section. 
1. Now you need to add values to your option by clicking the **Add new value** button. 
1. Fill in the **Title field** - it will show on the front-end for some option types (by default it is hidden for Swatches). If you select the checkbox called **Default**, this value will be pre-selected when the product page is loaded. 
1. Since we’re creating a Swatch, now you should provide and image or choose a color for your swatch. To do that click on **Images & Colors** beneath the **Title** field. 
1. Now you would add the remaining values to this option, and then move on add additional options to this option set, if needed. 
1. We recommend periodically clicking **Save** at the top right of the screen to preserve you progress.
1. Optional: now you can move on to [adding rules](rules-and-conditions.html) to your option set  
1. And, finally, you need to [assign this option set to your products](add-options-via-option-sets.html).
