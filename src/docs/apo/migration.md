# Migrating from the old version of the app

Currently it is not yet possible to automatically migrate your data from the previous generation of the app. However, we are working on a migration mechanist that will make it possible. 

Meanwhile, if you are ok with re-creating all your options manually, feel free to uninstall the old app, and reinstall it again from the [Shopify app store](https://apps.shopify.com/advanced-product-options). In such case, you will get the latest version of the app. However, you would have to create all options over again from scratch.
